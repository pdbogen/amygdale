== SETUP =======================================================================
================================================================================

Requires the following perl modules:
	YAML
	POE
	POE::Session
	POE::Component::IRC
	POE::Wheel::SocketFactory
	POE::Wheel::ReadWrite

At the time of writing, these are obtainable from, but you should really
just use CPAN:
	http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/I/IN/INGY/YAML-0.39.tar.gz
	http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/R/RC/RCAPUTO/POE-0.3101.tar.gz
	http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/B/BI/BINGOS/POE-Component-IRC-4.66.tar.gz

================================================================================
== CONFIGURATION ===============================================================
================================================================================

Configuration is done through the 'config.yaml' file, which uses YAML
("YAML Ain't a Markup Language" ). Config directives are like:
	<NAME>: '<blah>'

There's some special stuff if <blah> contains certain characters, but I
don't know what they are, and they shouldn't be needed. Don't blame me
if you break it. (But I'll still try to help fix it if you tell me)

HISTORY: <Number of Lines>

	Amygdale can internally store a unified chat history. This 
	configuration parameter controls how many lines are stored.

SERVERS: <protocol>://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>[/<options>]

	The following protocols are supported:
	
	irc: Internet Relay Chat
		* The first option MUST be the name of a channel or channels
		(comma-separated) to join upon connecting
		* The following options may be any combination of:
			ircname=<text>
			username=<text>
			tag=<text>
			showjoin		Toggles whether joins and parts to the channel
							are reported.
		
		Ex.:
			irc://a@irc.tamu.edu/#test
			irc://a:potrzebie@irc.efnet.org/#somechannel,#anotherchannel
			irc://Frank@irc.random.com/#foo/ircname=Frank/username=Not&space;I
		
	
	dcn: Direct Connect chat
		* Options may be any combination of:
			tag=<text>		The tag for this server (shown between [] when
							sent to other servers)
			share=<number>	The reported share for this server (might be
							needed for servers with minimum share sizes)
			debug			If set, ALL lines received from the DC server
							will be printed to the console
		
		Ex.:
			dcn://a@valknut.dyndns.info:59176
	
	Multiple servers can be specified; just separate them with whitespace.
	
	The following escape sequences are permissible and understood for
	configuration parameters:
		&colon;	= ':'
		&space; = ' '
		&slash; = '/'
		&amp;	= '&'
